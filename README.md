# CS170-PacmanProject
Pacman project for Dr. LePendu's CS 170 (Intro to Artificial Intelligence) course @ UCR.

**Engineer:** Deven Fafard  
**Lines of Code:** 264 (written by me)  


## Activity Summary:
#### Most Challenging Activities
The most challenging activity for me was implementing the Q5 (finding all the corners). It was really hard to break down the problem at each step, and I struggled with connecting the dots (pun intended) with getting the successor states.

#### Most Interesting Activities
The most interesting activities for me were implementing the various search algorithms. I was surprised by the fact that the difference mostly came down to the data structure used to hold the frontier nodes. It seemed to me that it would be non-trivial to implement the other search algorithms, but I was pleasantly surprised.

#### Most Pride-Inducing Activities
I was the most proud of implementing the first algorithm, depth first search. I didn’t think that I would be able to figure it out, but I was able to tease out a solution. My feelings are best summed up by this Reddit comment (pardon the french):

## Post Mortem:  
#### What tasks were accomplished?
I was able to implement Q1 (DFS), Q2 (BFS), Q3 (Uniform Cost), Q4 (A*), Q5 (A* w/ heuristic), and Q7 (Food Heuristic).
What planned tasks were not done?
I was not able to implement Q6 (Corner Heuristic) and Q8 (Suboptimal Search). I spent a long time struggling with Q5 and I ran out of time.

#### How was it working alone?
I decided to work alone on this project because I overloaded my time this quarter. I work full time and am enrolled in another class besides this one, so I knew that I would be a garbage teammate. I keep strange working hours and knew that it would probably lead to any teammates picking up my slack. That being said, it was really difficult working alone. The professor strongly recommended that we work in groups and I understand why. Once some cornerstone questions are answered (namely Q1), it is easy enough to parallelize work on the other questions. I wish I had a teammate to help me out when I was feeling overwhelmed. While it’s nice to work alone, there is something to be said for being in the trenches with someone.

#### What would I do differently?
Given a do-over, I would likely let the professor know that I was struggling much earlier. I would also look for a teammate!
